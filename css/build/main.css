/*A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, 
a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any 
pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. 
It is defining the default styling for how that element should
look in all occurrences on the page. */
/*A Module is a more discrete component of the page.
It is your navigation bars and your carousels and your
dialogs and your widgets and so on. This is the meat of
the page. Modules sit inside Layout components.*/
/* State is something that augments and overrides all other styles.
For example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or
expanded state. A message may be in a success or error state. */
